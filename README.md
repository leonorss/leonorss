# Hi, I'm Leonor :blush:

<img src="https://github.com/leonorss/leonorss/blob/main/logo_banner.png" alt="Banner of my interests">

I have a Master’s degree in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics and experience in analysing different NGS data such as transcriptomic, epigenomic, genomics and spatial data (Imaging Mass Cytometry data, CosMx data) using python, R and the command line environment. I have a strong computational background from my Bachelor’s degree in Computational Science and Engineering, coupled with the ability to understand and apply my knowledge to biological and cellular studies from my Master’s degree. I am currently working on translational Pancreatic and Colorectal Cancer Research, collaborating with wet-lab scientists on cellline experiments and patient cohorts. Leveraging my expertise and curiosity to solve problems, I am excited to contribute to the cutting-edge field of precision medicine and drug discovery.
